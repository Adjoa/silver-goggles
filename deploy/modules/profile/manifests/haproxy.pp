  # - collected_exported setting indicates that Puppet's exported resources feature
  #   will not be used to collect information about the web servers being managed
  # - ipaddress setting defines the shared virtual IP address to be contacted by 
  #   clients and associated with the relevant web servers
  # - ports setting indicates which ports to listen on for the address specified in 
  #   ipaddress
  # - options setting indicates that, as dictated by the http mode, client requests 
  #   will be analyzed in depth before connecting to any server, any request which
  #   is not RFC-compliant will be rejected and layer 7 filtering, processing and 
  #   switching will be possible.
